    <div class="item7"><h2>Web 3.0</h2>
    <p>Web 3.0, also known as the semantic web, was introduced in 2016. 
      The Semantic Webâ€™s purpose was to create a more intelligent web by linking other pieces of data in order to give the user a more intuitive experience as they look for information on the browser. 
      The vision was to create an environment where most of the data could be linked and was openly accessible to the public. 
      This was also a time when AI became more prominent and data management grew to be more efficient.</p></div>
