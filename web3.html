          <p>Web 3.0, also known as the semantic web, was introduced in 2016. 
          The Semantic Webâ€™s purpose was to create a more intelligent web by linking other pieces of data in order to give the user a more intuitive experience as they look for information on the browser.
          The vision was to create an environment where most of the data could be linked and is openly accessible to the public. AI, or Artificial Intelligence started to grow more notoriety at this time. 
          One use for AI is being able to personalize and provide a more accurate search result the more you use a search browser.</p>
          <p>Web 3.0 also introduced more immersive experiences such as 'The Metaverse'. This is often associated with VR (Virtual Reality), where users are able to interact in a digital 3D space in real time.
          Outside of 'The Metaverse', technologies such as 'WebGL', 'Babylon.js', 'Unity WebGL', etc, are able to provide real-time 3D graphics on to web browsers, unlike Web 2.0 which was mostly 2D.
          The best part is that there is no plugin or installation required, as any user is able to click on a link and it will run properly.</p>
          <p>It was also at this time that Web 3.0 introduced better security measures. Distrubited Ledger Technology (DLT) is a digital system was introduced in Web 3.0 that essentially stores data but in multiple different nodes. 
          Each node holds a copy of the same data and works together to verify the accuracy of new records. This makes it difficult to tamper with the data and ensures database integrity, as the data is continuously being replicated and validated across all nodes.</p> 
            
          <p>One good example of DLT would be the Blockchain. It bundles in multiple transactions all at once then sends it to the nodes to verify each transaction.</p>
