          <p>Web 1.0 began in 1989 to 2005 and had multiple different names, "The Static Web", "Read-Only Web", "The Early Web", etc. This was because web pages back then could not be interacted with or changed. What you see on
          a web page is what you get. This is also what is referred to as a 'static page', which is a web page that remains fixed or does not change.</p>
          <p>HTML is the core language that is used to create the foundation of a webpage. Web pages in 'The Static Web' were very primitive by today's standards. A typical web page would be a document that had a few headers, some paragraphs, and sometimes a few images. 
          This is equivalent to a Google Document or a Word Document. This included hyperlinks which are clickable links that sends you to other webpages. Webpages could also display gifs or jpegs which are both image formats.</p> 
          <p>To share a webpage on the Internet, it must use a protocol called HTTP, which allows information to be communicated and transferred from web servers to web browsers. People can view a webpage by typing in a URL, 
          which tells the server what resource is being requested. The server then responds by sending back the appropriate webpage or file. </p>
