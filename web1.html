  <p>Web 1.0 began in 1989 and ended in 2005. It was considered a “read-only” web that could not be interacted with as it was a static page in the form of a document. 
A static page refers to a web page that remains fixed or does not change. 
      The main features the Web 1.0 had at the time were the multitude of internet applications along with various protocols. Namely HTTP (Hyper Transfer Protocol) and HTML (Hypertext Markup Language).</p></div>
