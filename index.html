      <div class="text">
        <p>Tim Berners-Lee was born on June 8th, 1955 and is most well known as an English computer scientist who invented the World Wide Web (WWW). 
        The World Wide Web is a client server application with web pages filled with information and services. He coined the term "World Wide Web" because he wanted it to be a universal system where information could be accessed all through the Internet.</p>
        <p>He has also invented HTML (HyperText Markup Language), HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol),
        and URL (Uniform Resource Locator). The web primarily uses the Hyper Transfer Protocol to access these web pages in the first place and HyperText Markup Language to format them. Uniform Resource Locator refers to an address that can be used to locate resources on a computer network.
        Burners-Lee developed all of these as a foundation of the World Wide Web.</p>
        <p>Throughout this website, we will be going through the evolution of the World Wide Web and it's most notable features throughout each era.</p>
