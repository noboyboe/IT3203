  <h1>What is the web?</h1>
  <p>The web, or the World Wide Web (WWW), is a client server application with web pages filled with information and services. 
    The web primarily uses the Hyper Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to access these web pages in the first place and 
 HyperText Markup Language (HTML) to format them. </p>
